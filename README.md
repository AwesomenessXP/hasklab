# HaskLab
- My blog where I post everything I've learned about code.

## Setting up:
- install npm
- install these dependencies:
  - luxon (for time formatting)
  - helmet (security)
  - express-validator (form validation/sanitization)
  - async (so we can run multiple async funcs at the same time or sequentially)
  - compression (to compress http response time)
  - mongoose (ORM for mongoDB)
